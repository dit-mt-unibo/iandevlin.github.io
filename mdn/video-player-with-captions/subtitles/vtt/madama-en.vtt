1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.500
One day, we'll see.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Remove a wire of smoke on the end

3
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.000
Border of the sea.

4
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.000
And then the ship appears

5
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.000
And then the ship is white.

6
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:52.000
Step into the harbor, shake his greeting.

7
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.000
See, he came!

8
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm not going to meet him, I'm not. I stand

9
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.000
there on the edge of the hill and wait, wait

10
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.000
Great time and it doesn't weigh me down

11
00:01:50.300 --> 00:02:00.000
 The long wait.

12
00:02:18.300 --> 00:03:22.000
And... out of the city crowd.
 A man, a tiny dot
Itstarts up the hill.
Who will it be?
 And how did he get here?
 What's he gonna say?
 He'll call Butterfly from afar.
Me without giving an answer I'll be
 hiding.
 A little for celia, a little not to die
At the first meeting, and he was somewhat distressed
He'll call, he'll call:
Piccina - Wife Vervain
 Olezzo
 The names he gave me when he came.
This is gonna happen, I promise.
Keep your fear. â€“ I'm sure.
 Faith awaits.
